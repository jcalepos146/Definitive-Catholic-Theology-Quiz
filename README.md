## AI Integration Notes

The AI Theological Guide attempts to connect to the Anthropic API. For this to work:
- The feature is designed to work in environments where the API is accessible
- If you're self-hosting, you may need to configure API access
- The quiz works fully without the AI feature — citations provide an alternative

## Credits
